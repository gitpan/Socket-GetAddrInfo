Revision history for Socket-GetAddrInfo

0.08_3  BUGFIXES:
         * Use ExtUtils::CBuilder to compile the test .c file in the
           Configure() stage, to make it (hopefully) more portable
         * Some OSes return $err==0 but no results for invalid names - make
           sure the test script can cope.

0.08_2  BUGFIXES:
         * Declare variables in "PREINIT" XS section, not "INIT"; keeps
           non-C99 compilers happy
         * Skip tests that require internet connectivity unless the tester
           declares it possible
         * Declare test counts upfront in testing scripts
         * Renamed XS functions 'getaddrinfo' and 'getnameinfo'; no need to
           prefix with 'real_'
         * Folded Configure.pl inline into Build.PL, in case it has to make
           further decisions

0.08_1  CHANGES:
         * Complete rewrite to XS+PP emulation system. No longer uses Socket6
           on account of API and error reporting issues.
         * Provided two styles of API at import time (:newapi and :Socket6api)
           to allow caller to choose between RFC2553-like or Socket6 styles

0.07    BUGFIXES:
         * Ensure that emulated getaddrinfo() copes with family=AF_UNSPEC (0)

0.06    BUGFIXES:
         * Avoid (harmless) "Constant subroutine .. redefined" warnings if
           'use'd multiple times, when Socket6 is not available.

0.05    CHANGES:
         * Reworded DESCRIPTION section of documentation
         * Fixed some bugs in the SYNOPSIS example

0.04    BUGFIXES:
         * Declare dependency on Test::Exception
         * Fixed skip count in test in 01getaddrinfo-socket6.t

0.03    CHANGES:
         * Changed getnameinfo() to avoid needing sockaddr_family(), which
           avoids a version check, which means it works on perl 5.6.1

0.02    BUGFIXES:
         * Declare required version of Socket.pm sufficient to have
           sockaddr_family()

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
