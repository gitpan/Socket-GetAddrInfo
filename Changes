Revision history for Socket-GetAddrInfo

0.03    CHANGES:
         * Changed getnameinfo() to avoid needing sockaddr_family(), which
           avoids a version check, which means it works on perl 5.6.1

0.02    BUGFIXES:
         * Declare required version of Socket.pm sufficient to have
           sockaddr_family()

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
