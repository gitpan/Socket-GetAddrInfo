Revision history for Socket-GetAddrInfo

0.06    BUGFIXES:
         * Avoid (harmless) "Constant subroutine .. redefined" warnings if
           'use'd multiple times, when Socket6 is not available.

0.05    CHANGES:
         * Reworded DESCRIPTION section of documentation
         * Fixed some bugs in the SYNOPSIS example

0.04    BUGFIXES:
         * Declare dependency on Test::Exception
         * Fixed skip count in test in 01getaddrinfo-socket6.t

0.03    CHANGES:
         * Changed getnameinfo() to avoid needing sockaddr_family(), which
           avoids a version check, which means it works on perl 5.6.1

0.02    BUGFIXES:
         * Declare required version of Socket.pm sufficient to have
           sockaddr_family()

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
