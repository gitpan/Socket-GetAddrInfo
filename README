NAME
    `Socket::GetAddrInfo' - RFC 2553's `getaddrinfo' and `getnameinfo'
    functions.

SYNOPSIS
     use Socket qw( SOCK_STREAM );
     use Socket::GetAddrInfo qw( getaddrinfo getnameinfo );
     use IO::Socket;

     my $sock;

     my %hints = ( socktype => SOCK_STREAM );
     my ( $err, @res ) = getaddrinfo( "www.google.com", "www", \%hints );

     die "Cannot resolve name - $err" if $err;

     while( my $ai = shift @res ) {

        $sock = IO::Socket->new();
        $sock->socket( $ai->{family}, $ai->{socktype}, $ai->{protocol} ) or
           undef $sock, next;

        $sock->connect( $ai->{addr} ) or undef $sock, next;

        last;
     }

     if( $sock ) {
        my ( $err, $host, $service ) = getnameinfo( $sock->peername );
        print "Connected to $host:$service\n" if !$err;
     }

DESCRIPTION
    The RFC 2553 functions `getaddrinfo' and `getnameinfo' provide an
    abstracted way to convert between a pair of host name/service name and
    socket addresses, or vice versa. `getaddrinfo' converts names into a set
    of arguments to pass to the `socket()' and `connect()' syscalls, and
    `getnameinfo' converts a socket address back into its host name/service
    name pair.

    These functions provide a useful interface for performing either of
    these name resolution operation, without having to deal with IPv4/IPv6
    transparency, or whether the underlying host can support IPv6 at all, or
    other such issues. However, not all platforms can support the underlying
    calls at the C layer, which means a dilema for authors wishing to write
    forward-compatible code. Either to support these functions, and cause
    the code not to work on older platforms, or stick to the older "legacy"
    resolvers such as `gethostbyname()', which means the code becomes more
    portable.

    This module attempts to solve this problem, by detecting at compiletime
    whether the underlying OS will support these functions. If it does not,
    the module will use pure-perl emulations of the functions using the
    legacy resolver functions instead. The emulations support the same
    interface as the real functions, and behave as close as is resonably
    possible to emulate using the legacy resolvers. See
    Socket::GetAddrInfo::Emul for details on the limits of this emulation.

    As of Perl version 5.14.0, Perl already supports `getaddrinfo' in core.
    On such a system, this module simply uses the functions provided by
    `Socket', and does not need to use its own compiled XS, or pure-perl
    legacy emulation.

FUNCTIONS
  ( $err, @res ) = getaddrinfo( $host, $service, $hints )
    When given both host and service, this function attempts to resolve the
    host name to a set of network addresses, and the service name into a
    protocol and port number, and then returns a list of address structures
    suitable to connect() to it.

    When given just a host name, this function attempts to resolve it to a
    set of network addresses, and then returns a list of these addresses in
    the returned structures.

    When given just a service name, this function attempts to resolve it to
    a protocol and port number, and then returns a list of address
    structures that represent it suitable to bind() to.

    When given neither name, it generates an error.

    The optional `$hints' parameter can be passed a HASH reference to
    indicate how the results are generated. It may contain any of the
    following four fields:

    flags => INT
            A bitfield containing `AI_*' constants

    family => INT
            Restrict to only generating addresses in this address family

    socktype => INT
            Restrict to only generating addresses of this socket type

    protocol => INT
            Restrict to only generating addresses for this protocol

    Errors are indicated by the `$err' value returned; which will be
    non-zero in numeric context, and contain a string error message as a
    string. The value can be compared against any of the `EAI_*' constants
    to determine what the error is. Rather than explicitly checking, see
    also Socket::GetAddrInfo::Strict which provides functions that throw
    exceptions on errors.

    If no error occurs, `@res' will contain HASH references, each
    representing one address. It will contain the following five fields:

    family => INT
            The address family (e.g. AF_INET)

    socktype => INT
            The socket type (e.g. SOCK_STREAM)

    protocol => INT
            The protocol (e.g. IPPROTO_TCP)

    addr => STRING
            The address in a packed string (such as would be returned by
            pack_sockaddr_in)

    canonname => STRING
            The canonical name for the host if the `AI_CANONNAME' flag was
            provided, or `undef' otherwise. This field will only be present
            on the first returned address.

  ( $err, $host, $service ) = getnameinfo( $addr, $flags, $xflags )
    This function attempts to resolve the given socket address into a pair
    of host and service names.

    The optional `$flags' parameter is a bitfield containing `NI_*'
    constants.

    The optional `$xflags' parameter is a bitfield containing `NIx_*'
    constants. The two constants are `NIx_NOHOST' and `NIx_NOSERV'. These
    are a Perl-level extension of the API to request looking up only the
    service name or host name respectively, when only one is required.

    Errors are indicated by the `$err' value returned; which will be
    non-zero in numeric context, and contain a string error message as a
    string. The value can be compared against any of the `EAI_*' constants
    to determine what the error is. Rather than explicitly checking, see
    also Socket::GetAddrInfo::Strict which provides functions that throw
    exceptions on errors.

BUILDING WITHOUT XS CODE
    In some environments it may be preferred not to build the XS
    implementation, leaving a choice only of the core or pure-perl emulation
    implementations.

BUGS
    *   Appears to FAIL on older Darwin machines (e.g. `osvers=8.11.1'). The
        failure mode occurs in t/02getnameinfo.t and appears to relate to an
        endian bug; expecting to receive `80' and instead receiving `20480'
        (which is a 16-bit `80' byte-swapped).
